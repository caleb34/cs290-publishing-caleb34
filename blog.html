    <p><strong>Challenges with this Assignment</strong></p>
    <p>
        For me, the hardest part of this first assignment was coordinating between Github, my file directory, and Visual Studios. I addressed
        these difficulties by revisiting the lectures, watching videos about Github, and reading the Git-it page. 
    <p><strong>What I Learned</strong></p>
    <p>
        I learned how to place files in adjacent locations, place an image on a webpage, and push files from Visual Studios to Github. I did
        already have experience with Github from CS 161/162, but the process was a bit different for Visual Studios. I also had to look up 
        how to open a local file in Google Chrome.

    <p><strong>Helpful Resources</strong></p>
    <p>
        The most helpful resources for completing this assignment were YouTube, Git-it, and the lecture recordings.
